# Design Patterns And SOLID Principles

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that arise in software design, particularly in the context of object-oriented programming (OOP). These patterns provide a template or structure for solving certain types of problems, making it easier for developers to write maintainable and efficient code.

## What is UML?

[UML](https://www.uml.org/what-is-uml.htm), short for Unified Modeling Language, is a standardized modeling language consisting of an integrated set of diagrams, developed to help system and software developers for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, as well as for business modeling and other non-software systems.
